>The Mighty Linked-Graph


## Introducation


The Linked-Graph is an interactive English dictionary and thesaurus, it can help you to find the meanings of the word explained by pure English. What makes it unique is the drawing part, it can draw connections to all the associated words. In the graph, you see why they are connected clearly. It's truly a powerful English words learning assistant.

Here is why you would like it:
   

* Easy to use dictionary and thesaurus.
* Learn how words associate in a visually interactive display.
* Get ideas to help your writings, for example the content for your blog, article, thesis,
* Simply play with these words!
* No registration required.
* No network required, it is all local
* Itâ€™s free and fun!


The database comes from Princeton University, they made it available for students and language researchers. This dictionary groups synonyms into synsets through lexical relations between terms. These meanings and semantic relationships are revealed graphically by the interactive technology made available by me :)

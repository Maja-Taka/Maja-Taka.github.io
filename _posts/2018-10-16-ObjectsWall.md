## Introducation


Ever thinking of teaching your kids by cards? Which is arguably the most nature way of learning.

We have prepared your kids with a wide range of card objects, they do not need to know the spelling or the writing, by listening only they can learn a lot.

Here are some key features:

* Easy to use, neat UI
* Single tap on card to hear the word
* Sometimes a single tap may trigger the sound, watch out :)
* Double tap or pinch out to have a fullscreen view
* In fullscreen mode, swipe up/down to see more cards
* There are Student(Free) mode and Teacher mode
* In Teacher Mode, 10 random cards are selected to test your kids.


Stay tuned as more categories will be added really soon!
